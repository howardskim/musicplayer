# Music Player in Vanilla jS
## Overview
> This project was built in Vanilla JavaScript with the revealing module pattern. 
A dynamic trackbar is included at the top that continuously loads in relation to where the song is playing.
The theme and colors were inspired by Spotify and personally this project taught me about different patterns one can use
to build with JavaScript. This type of pattern uses closures and taught me about importing and exporting along with very handy ES shortcuts.
This prepared me for what was to come in learning React.
